            Though subsequent Jordans were created by Nike design wizard Tinker Hatfield – creator of the Air Max 1, the Air Huarache and the MAG, or ‘the Back to the Future shoe’ – the Air Jordan 1 was designed by a less well-known name. Peter Moore was part of a small group of Nike executives who began working with Michael Jordan shortly after he left the University of North Carolina and joined the Chicago Bulls. Moore designed the shoe with input from Michael, who specified something eye-catching and low, so he could feel the court beneath his feet. Moore also came with a pocket of compressed air in the sole to cushion impact. The New York Times called the new shoes ‘spacebootlike’.‘The idea was to break the colour barrier in footwear,’ Moore wrote in his 1995 book Peter Moore: A Portfolio. ‘Prior to that, 99 per cent of shoes were white or black, so I decided to design a shoe that would really take colour well. And the colours were red, black and white.’ Moore didn’t pick them at random – they belonged to the Chicago Bulls franchise. Michael Jordan was less keen – he called them ‘the devil’s colours’ – unsuccessfully arguing for the blue of his college uniform.

            The Air Jordans' exclusive level relative to other types of footwear has been the reason behind this phenomenon. They made these sneakers with extremely high-quality materials like full-grain calfskin and premium leather uppers like boots. Thus, people cannot marvel at the look and feel of a high-quality product.The new movie Air tells the story of how Nike courted basketball player Michael Jordan, stealing him away from rivals Converse and Adidas. In a deal that gave the player his own shoe line – the Air Jordan – as well as points on every pair sold, it revolutionised sports marketing and turned around Nike’s fortunes. Air is directed by Ben Affleck, who also plays Nike co-founder and CEO Phil Knight. Affleck’s long-time collaborator Matt Damon plays Sonny Vaccaro, the middle-aged Nike exec who stakes his reputation on the then-unheard-of Chicago Bulls player. Ahead of its release, here’s ten takeaways from the story of the Air Jordan.Though subsequent Jordans were created by Nike design wizard Tinker Hatfield – creator of the Air Max 1, the Air Huarache and the MAG, or ‘the Back to the Future shoe’ – the Air Jordan 1 was designed by a less well-known name.
